## Steps to Exploit  

1. **Deploy the Machine**  
   Start by deploying the vulnerable machine and accessing it via its assigned IP address.  

2. **Gather Information**  
   - Visit the website hosted on the target machine.  
   - Identify the name and version of the application running on the machine. This information is typically displayed on the homepage or can be extracted using tools like `WhatWeb` or `Wappalyzer`.  

3. **Search for Vulnerabilities**  
   - Use the application name and version to search for related CVEs in public vulnerability databases such as [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com) or [CVE Details](https://cvedetails.com).  

4. **Obtain a Working Exploit**  
   - Download an exploit for the identified vulnerability.  
   - If the exploit is written in older Python syntax (e.g., `urllib.quote`, `print` without brackets), update the code to ensure compatibility with your Python version.  

5. **Modify the Exploit**  
   - Change the target URL in the exploit to the IP address of the vulnerable machine.  
   - For reverse shell exploits, configure the payload with your attack machine's IP address and the port you will be listening on.  

6. **Execute the Exploit**  
   - Run the modified exploit against the target machine.  
   - If using a reverse shell exploit, start a listener on your attack machine with `nc -lvnp <PORT>`.  

7. **Retrieve the Flag**  
   - Once you have remote code execution or shell access, navigate to `/home/ubuntu/flag.txt` on the target machine.  
   - Read the flag using a command like `cat /home/ubuntu/flag.txt`.
